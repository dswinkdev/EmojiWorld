# Emoji🌍World
Finally... a place where emojis can play! 🦖🪐✨

Emoji World is a simple yet fun Java console application that allows users to generate patterns of their favorite emojis in a grid format. Users can specify the number of columns and rows for the grid and choose any emoji they want to display. The program continues to prompt the user for new grids until they decide to exit.

Features:<br>
• Interactive Input: Users are prompted to input the number of columns, rows, and their chosen emoji.<br>
• Dynamic Grid Generation: The program generates a grid of emojis based on the user’s input.<br>
• Exit Condition: Users can gracefully exit the program by entering -1 for either rows or columns, or by typing "quit" when asked for an emoji.<br>
• Welcoming Interface: The program displays a welcoming "Emoji World" introduction with a mix of emojis, adding a fun visual element before the interaction begins.
